## Overview

**LNS Housing** by **LumaNode Studios** is a state-of-the-art, feature-complete housing and real estate ecosystem engineered for modern FiveM servers. Designed to replace outdated, unoptimized housing resources, LNS Housing combines a database-backed foundation with high-performance bridging and an ultra-modern React 19 UI suite.

Going far beyond standard teleport-and-stash scripts, **LNS Housing** introduces deep, immersive living mechanics: an **interactive electricity and power grid** with circuit breaker trips, **interior climate & temperature control**, a **real-time lawn growth and mowing simulation**, **timed auctions and rental contracts with legal paper signing**, **interactive 3D battering ram police breaches**, **live doorbell camera feeds**, an **NPC locksmith with physical key support**, and an **automated green-screen prop thumbnail pipeline** with CDN upload integration.

## Key Features

### 🏢 Real Estate Agency & Market Economy
* **Interactive Tablet UI (`/housing`):** Full-featured dashboard for browsing listings, managing properties, and checking agency balances.
* **Versatile Sales Models:**
  * **Direct Sale:** Standard bank purchase with instant ownership transfer.
  * **Timed Auctions:** Live real-time bidding system with configurable starting bids and timers.
  * **Rental Leases:** Recurring weekly lease payments with automatic database billing (even for offline players).
* **Legal Paper Contract System:** Agents draft official purchase or rental contracts specifying deposits and commissions. Clients review and sign authentic, physical-style paper contract documents (`ContractPaper`).
* **Tenant & Lease Management:** Automated grace periods, late fees, lockout modes, temporary retrieval periods, and realtor eviction controls.
* **Renter Blacklist:** Real estate agencies can blacklist delinquent renters with Citizen ID, name, and reason tracking.
* **In-Game 3-Step Property Wizard:** Complete in-game creator tool with door picking, garage coordinates, vehicle spawn points, breaker box locations, doorbell camera placement, and camera screenshot capture.

### ⚡ Electricity, Power Grid & Climate Simulation
* **Dynamic Electrical Load:** Configurable kWh consumption per placed appliance (lamps, TVs, refrigerators, heating units).
* **Circuit Breakers & Overload:** Exceeding maximum circuit capacity trips the breaker, plunging the house into darkness until reset via an interactive skill-check minigame.
* **Electrical Upgrades:** Upgradable grid tiers from Standard Circuit (5.0 kWh) up to Industrial Power Grid (50.0 kWh).
* **Ambient Climate & Temperature:** Furniture items impact room heating and cooling (°C or °F), visible in real time on the property dashboard.

### 🛡️ Security, Raids & Locksmith
* **Upgradable Locks (Tiers 0–5):** Upgradable security tiers featuring scaled lockpicking minigame difficulty (rotational angles, speed, and rounds).
* **Burglar Alarm System:** Configurable failed-attempt thresholds trigger audible burglar sirens backed by custom audio packs (`lns_sounds.dat54.rel` / `lns_bank.awc`).
* **Interactive 3D Battering Ram Breach:** Police use physical mouse drag-and-strike mechanics to repeatedly ram doors open with custom animations, models, and impact audio.
* **Police Stash Raids:** Authorized officers can force open locked storage containers using dedicated breach tools.
* **Physical Key System & NPC Locksmith:** Metadata-bound key items (`house_key`) cut from blank keys at an NPC locksmith, featuring support for stolen key burglary RP and per-property key limits.
* **Doorbell Camera & Live Feed:** Physical CCTV camera prop mounted at entrance, offering live security camera viewing and interactive 3D camera repositioning.

### 🛋️ Furniture Studio & Automated Thumbnail Pipeline
* **Massive Catalog:** Over 5,000+ lines of pre-configured furniture props across seating, tables, beds, lighting, decor, and storage.
* **Precision 3D Modeler:** Freecam mode, translation/rotation gizmos, snapping controls, alpha transparency previews, and real-time shopping cart.
* **Functional Props:** Place interactive storage stashes (`ox_inventory`), wardrobes (`illenium-appearance`), property control tablets, and character logout points.
* **Automated Green-Screen Prop Pipeline (`/takeshots`):** Built-in studio isolation that spawns props in a private routing bucket, frames them, captures screenshots, strips chroma-key green in Node.js, sharpens/crops thumbnails, and uploads directly to **Qbox CDN**, **Fivemanage**, **Cloudflare R2**, or local storage.

### 🌱 Dynamic Lawn Mower & Yard Simulation
* **Real-Time Grass Growth:** Deterministic, server-synced grass growth simulation across polygon yard zones defined via in-game zone tools.
* **Interactive Mowing:** Push lawnmowers with custom prop handling and walking animations, or ride-on mower vehicles (`mower`).
* **Dynamic Culling:** Grass props dynamically sink, disappear when cut, and render efficiently based on player proximity.

### 🗑️ Junk & Garbage Bins
Off by default (`Cleaning.Enabled` in `shared/settings.lua`). Full guide: [Install/junk.md](Install/junk.md).
* **Junk builds up:** While someone is inside an owned house, a piece of junk appears every few minutes (up to 10 at a time). Apartments are not affected.
* **Keyholders clean it:** The owner and anyone with entry permission use the "Sweep up" target to bag it. Each piece gives one `trash_bag` item tagged with the property it came from, so a bin only accepts bags swept up in its own house.
* **Bring it outside:** Bags go into the property's garbage bin with "Dump trash bags". By default they simply disappear. With `Bin.KeepContents = true` they stay in the bin (up to `Bin.Capacity`, shown as a pile beside it) so other scripts can use them.
* **Bin placement:** Agents place the bin in the listing editor ("Garbage Bin Location"). Owners can place, move or remove it from the property tablet (Settings tab).
* **Build your own pickup:** Server exports (`GetPropertyBins`, `SetBinFill`, `EmptyBin`) let any job or script decide what happens to the bags in a bin (needs `Bin.KeepContents = true`).
* **Setup:** add a `trash_bag` item to your inventory (snippet in [Install/junk.md](Install/junk.md)).

### 🏠 Starter Apartments
* **Turnkey Multi-Unit Housing:** Complete starter apartment system with pre-configured WIWANG Apartments SQL data.
* **Concierge & Shared Services:** Lobby receptionist NPC, shared breaker boxes, and routing bucket isolation.
* **In-Game Apartment Creator:** Create and edit multi-room apartment complexes on the fly (`/createapartment`, `/editapartment`).
