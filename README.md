## Overview

**LNS Housing** by **LumaNode Studios** is a state-of-the-art, feature-complete housing and real estate system designed for FiveM servers. It completely replaces legacy, unoptimized housing resources with a modern, database-backed solution.

Rather than just a simple spawn-and-teleport script, **LNS Housing** introduces deep, immersive mechanics: **interactive furniture shop and placement**, a **dynamic lawn growth and mowing system**, **real estate agency job flows** with contracts and employee permissions, and a highly optimized **starter apartments framework** with seamless spawn integrations.

## Features

### Advanced Property Management & Editing
* **In-Game House Creator:** Admin commands (`/createhouse`) to quickly define shell locations, entrance/exit coordinates, pricing, and allowed agencies.
* **MLO & Shell support:** Built-in tools for both MLO-based houses and traditional teleporting shell interiors.
* **Wall Colors & Customization:** Real-time interior wall painting/color selection, allowing players to truly personalize their houses.

### Interactive Furniture & Shop
* **Rich Furniture Catalog:** Dozens of pre-configured furniture props across sofas, chairs, beds, tables, storage containers, lights, and decor.
* **Dynamic Placement UI:** Smooth translation, rotation, and height adjustment tools to position props precisely in-game.
* **Stashes & Wardrobes:** Place storage crates, lockers, wardrobes, or safes anywhere. Placing storage furniture automatically registers the containers with the inventory system.

### Dynamic Lawn Mower & Yard System
* **Grass Growth:** Grass props spawn dynamically in designated yard zones, growing in height over time.
* **Lawn Maintenance:** Players must mow their yard using a lawnmower item or drivable mower vehicles to maintain their properties.
* **Yard Customization:** Define specific lawn zone boundaries for any property using the built-in zone editor.

### Real Estate & Contracts
* **Agent Dashboard:** Real estate agents access a custom panel (`/properties`) to manage listings, adjust pricing, and hire employees.
* **Draft Purchase Contracts:** Draft legal agreements specifying commission rates, deposit requirements, and buyer parameters.
* **Agency Permissions:** Granular agent grades control access to creating listings, editing details, managing employees, or drafting contracts.

### Junk & Garbage Bins
Off by default. Turn it on with `Cleaning.Enabled = true` in `shared/settings.lua`.
* **Junk builds up:** While someone is inside an owned house, a piece of junk appears every few minutes (`Cleaning.Junk`, up to 10 at a time). Apartments are not affected.
* **Keyholders clean it:** The owner and anyone with a key use the "Sweep up" target on a piece to bag it. Each piece gives one `trash_bag` item tagged with the property it came from, so a bin only accepts bags swept up in its own house.
* **Bring it outside:** Bags go into the property's garbage bin with "Dump trash bags". The bin holds `Cleaning.Bin.Capacity` bags, shows bags piled beside it as it fills, and refuses more when full.
* **Bin placement:** Agents place the bin in the listing editor ("Garbage Bin Location"). Owners can place, move or remove it from the property tablet (Settings tab).
* **Garbage job hook:** Exports let a garbage job empty full bins (`GetCollectableBins`, `ClaimBin`, `ReleaseBin`, `CollectBin`).

Requires an `ox_inventory` item named `trash_bag`:
```lua
['trash_bag'] = {
    label = 'Trash Bag',
    weight = 500,
    stack = true,
    close = true,
    description = 'A bag of household junk. Take it to your garbage bin.',
},
```

### Security & Raids
* **Lockpicking:** Immersive minigame to lockpick house and apartment doors.
* **Police Breaches:** Authorize law enforcement agents to raid properties, bypass door locks, and search stashes under active warrants.
